        I grew up in a small town in New England. From painting to piano lessons, creativity was a part of my daily life. This held true until I went to college. A desire to explore the world and understand its people led me to pursue a degree in international relations. I sought out opportunities to work and study around the world--from Belize and Costa Rica to Rwanda and South Africa. After graduation, I spent five years working in the cycling industry.

        I didnâ€™t realize it at the time, but all of these experiences were important stepping stones on the path to pursuing a career in design. My youthful artistic pursuits helped me develop an appreciation for aesthetically pleasing visuals; studying international relations and traveling abroad deepened my interest in exploring and understanding the diversity of human experience; working in customer-facing roles in the cycling industry strengthened my communication skills and gave me an appreciation for the importance of user experience in the success of a business.

        Ultimately, I decided to become a designer because I am fascinated by people and the way that we interact with the world around us. I strive to design for inclusivity and draw upon a broad range of human experiences in my work. I believe that design and technology are powerful tools that can be used to create a more equitable world, and I am excited to use my skills to help create positive change.
