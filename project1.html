      <h2><span class="h2Underline">Summary</span></h2>
      <p>
        Breadbox is a cloud storage application that helps users organize their personal recipe collections and store them in a single, safe digital environment. With Breadbox, users can save recipes from multiple sources, share recipe files with family and friends, and use their recipe collection to create meal plans.

  <!-- Defining the Project -->
    <section class="projectDefinition">
      <div class="bar"><h2 class="blueBar">Defining the Project</h2></div>
      <h2><span class="h2Underline">The Problem</span></h2>
      <p>
        The cloud storage market is already home to well-known products like Google Drive, Dropbox, and Box. Can a new product succeed with the right combination of features to meet the needs of a particular audience? With this question in mind, I decided to focus this project on a specific market segment: recipe storage and management products.
      </p>
      <p>
        These days most of our documents, calendars, and photos are stored digitally. But recipes are often still stored as physical documents in cookbooks, on scraps of paper, or note cards. With the rise of recipe blogs and websites, and the enduring popularity of cookbooks, it can be easy to forget exactly where you found that great banana bread recipe. Users need a digital platform where recipes from many different sources can be stored.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/DashboardSolution.png" alt="The Breadbox dashboard, showing a user's meal plan and recently added recipes">
      </figure>
      <h2><span class="h2Underline">The Solution</span></h2>
      <p>
        In order to succeed in the already saturated cloud storage market, a new product needs to target a specific segment of the market. Breadbox does this and solves the problem of scattered and disorganized recipe storage by providing one centralized, digital storage solution for users’ entire recipe collections, no matter where their recipes are currently stored.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Breadbox, users can upload recipes manually, snap and save a photo of their recipes, or save links to their favorite recipe sites. Users can easily share their recipes with family and friends or create a meal plan using the recipes saved in their collection. Breadbox users will spend less time searching for recipes and have more time to spend enjoying their meals.

  <!-- User Survey -->
    <section class="survey">
      <h2><span class="h2Underline">User Survey</span></h2>
      <p>
        With a better understanding of existing recipe management products, I conducted a survey of potential users to gain a better understanding of their cooking habits and recipe management strategies.
      </p>
      <h3>Key Findings</h3>
      <section class="findingsGrid">
      <figure class="pieChart">
        <img src="images/PieChart84.png" alt="">

        <figcaption>98% of respondents plan meals in advance ‘sometimes’ or ‘always'</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </section>
      <p>
        The bulk of respondents who use recipes currently store them in a notebook or binder (50%) or in cookbooks (52%). Just 22% currently use a digital storage solution such as browser bookmarks or a recipe management app.
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially, I was unsure about whether the MVP should be designed as a responsive website or a mobile app. The user survey revealed that nearly 50% of potential users didn’t have a strong preference, and 65% reported viewing recipes on a computer more often than a phone. With this data in mind, I determined that Breadbox would be most useful as a responsive website.

        I prioritized the stories based on what I had learned in the user survey, and came up with 8 high priority stories that represented the core features of the project’s minimum viable product.

            With a structure for the MVP in place, I focused on creating a brand for the product. I decided to call it Breadbox since a breadbox is a common kitchen item that is used for food storage. Since the product is focused on recipe storage and meant to be used in the kitchen, it seemed fitting. ‘Box’ also brings to mind existing cloud storage products.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Breadbox brand is personal, fresh, and fun and conveys feelings of trust, ease, and reliability. Survey results indicated that users are interested in a straightforward product that doesn’t have too many bells and whistles, so this desire for ease and simplicity is reflected in the branding.

      <h3>Color Palette</h3>

        The primary brand colors are green and orange, colors that naturally bring to mind food items like leafy greens, carrots, oranges, and avocados.

      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <p>
        Both of the font families, Aleo and Cabin, are clean and approachable. Cabin is a sleek sans serif typeface used for the body text that works well with Breadbox’s text-heavy recipe content because it is very legible.

  <!-- Conclusion -->
    <section class="conclusion">
      <h2><span class="h2Underline">Conclusion</span></h2>
      <p>
        The process of designing Breadbox emphasized the importance of creating a solid foundation of research upon which to build a design. During the later stages of this project, I often went back to my notes from the user survey and the user personas to make sure that I was keeping the users at the forefront and not veering off course.
      </p>
      <p>
        In future iterations of this project, I would like to continue to add features to Breadbox that users expressed a desire for that fell outside the scope of the MVP. This could include the ability to create grocery lists in the app, and designing a more robust recipe detail view that would include additional information like personal recipe notes and photographs.
